# Using MongoDB

- Create a database called 'my_first_db'.
- Create students collection.
- Each document you insert into this collection should have the following format: ({name: STRING, home_state: STRING, lucky_number: NUMBER, birthday: {month: NUMBER, day: NUMBER, year: NUMBER}})
- Create 5 students with the appropriate info.
- Get all students.
- Retrieve all students who are from California (San Jose Dojo) or Washington (Seattle Dojo).
- Get all students whose lucky number is greater than 3
- Add a field to each student collection called 'interests' that is an ARRAY. It should contain the following entries: 'coding', 'brunch', 'MongoDB'. Do this in ONE operation.
- Add some unique interests for each particular student into each of their interest arrays.
- Add the interest 'taxes' into someone's interest array.
- Remove the 'taxes' interest you just added.
- Remove all students who are from California.
- Remove a student by name.
- Remove a student whose lucky number is greater than 5 (JUST ONE)
- Add a field to each student collection called 'number_of_belts' and set it to 0.
- Increment this field by 1 for all students in Washington (Seattle Dojo).
- Add a 'updated_on' field, and set the value as the current date.
