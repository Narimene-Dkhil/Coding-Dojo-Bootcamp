# Practice Assignment: Razor Fun!

### Learning Objectives:

- Render a View using Razor in a simple web application.
- Apply C# logic to render data on our View.
- Bonus: Apply conditional logic to affect how data renders.

## Directions
Using what you have learned about switching between C# logic and HTML, replicate the following wireframe. Create a new string List. Then iterate through the List. Generate a < p> tag for each iteration, and place the contents of the string from your List within the inner text of the < p> element.

**Bonus:** If the string in the List begins with the letter "c", style the < p> element with red text! (Do this using inline style for now since we have not gone over how to bring CSS files into our projects just yet.)

## Requirements:
- Create a web application that renders a cshtml page.
- Add a List of strings to Index.cshtml using Razor.
- Loop through the values in the List and print each one out in a p tag.
- Bonus: If the string in the array begins with the letter "c", style the p element with red text.
