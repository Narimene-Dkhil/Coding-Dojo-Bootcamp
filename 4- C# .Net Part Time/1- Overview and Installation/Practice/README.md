# Practice Assignment: Hello .NET!

### Learning Objectives:

- Verify that the dotnet installation is functioning properly and that the correct SDK version is installed.
- Construct and execute a working console project by interacting with the dotnet CLI.

## Directions
Test your installation and take .NET for a spin! To complete this assignment, take a screenshot of your terminal with the commands or save the commands from your terminal to a text file and upload it along with your project folder.

## Requirements:

- Run 'dotnet --version' in your terminal to verify the correct SDK was installed (should read 6.0.XXX)
- Create a new folder called "HelloDotnet" using the terminal.
- cd into HelloDotnet.
- Run 'dotnet new console' to spin up a new console application.
- Run 'dotnet run' and see the "Hello world!" message in your terminal. Your project is running!
- Screenshot your terminal showing the above commands working and include it with your project folder when you turn it in.
- Bonus: Do the needed steps to create a project, but using the single line command instead.
